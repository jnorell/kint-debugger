Kint Debugger makes debugging and dumping variables a more pleasant experience. Kint Debugger integrates seamlessly with the Debug Bar plugin.

== Description ==

Kint Debugger is a simple WordPress wrapper for [Kint](http://code.google.com/p/kint), a debugging tool to output information about variables and traces. Debugging is presented in a styled, collapsible format that is easy on the eyes. Kint Debugger plays nice with the Debug Bar plugin by creating its own panel to display your debug results.

**No more adding PRE tags before print_r or var_dump!**

For those who love Krumo, **Kint is Krumo++**.


Dumping variables is easy:

* `d($variable)` will output a styled, collapsible container with your variable information
* `dd($variable)` will do exactly as d() except halt execution of the script
* `s($variable)` will output a simple, un-styled whitespace container
* `sd($variable)` will do exactly as s() except halt execution of the script

Backtrace is also easy:

* `Kint::trace()` The displayed information for each step of the trace includes the source snippet, passed arguments and the object at the time of calling

We've also baked in a few functions that are WordPress specific:

* `dump_wp_query()`
* `dump_wp()`
* `dump_post()`

When you use the ever awesome Debug Bar plugin, Kint Debugger keeps your theme looking beautiful by placing all debug output into a Debug Bar sub-panel. If you are not using Debug Bar, your debug output will be displayed inline.

== Installation ==

Upload the Kint Debugger plugin to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate.
